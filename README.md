# Flask_App
A site I made for a group project for CPS530
It's objective was to simiply demo the use of Semetic UI as frontend and Flask as backend. Functionalitly was a bonus.

To create this application I refered:

Flask documentation:
http://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/

Corey Schafer's flask tutorial:

Note: He uses Bootstrap and I used Semetic UI so I had so adjust for all the the front-end aspects. Additionally I used a newer version of python than he did so there are small changes in code to his. I only followed until the 8th part.
