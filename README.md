# Flask_App
A site I made for a group project for CPS530
It's objective was to simiply demo the use of Semetic UI as frontend and Flask as backend. Functionalitly was a bonus.

In this project I learned The following:

-Flask templating which is to use code blocks to display html code lessening repetition.
-How to create routes 
-The creation of forms and how to handle the response using Flask
-How to handle form verification with Flask
-Creation of databases and models
-How to allow Flask to read and write data to the database
-How to handle user authorization so that users can only delete/update their own posts

Lastly I deployed the application I made to pythonanywhere: http://jonathanong.pythonanywhere.com/

To create this application I refered:

Flask documentation:

Note: He uses Bootstrap and I used Semetic UI so I had so adjust for all the the front-end aspects. Additionally I used a newer version of python than he did so there are small changes in code to his. I only followed until the 8th part.
